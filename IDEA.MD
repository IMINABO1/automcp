I want to create a software that generates, automatically generates MCPs, MCP tools for websites on Chrome. I'm not saying it, but... So I tried this already. Um, you create a Chrome extension that is looking at the website you're looking at. Then, as you're making things like, let's say you're using something like Trello, you make things like clicks, you add a card, you move a card, collapse a... I've forgotten those things that have, like, there's a done, do, and doing those three sections, collapse a section, get information about the body of it. Like, as you do all those actions, you have to, um, click on the extension, click on the all the things you did, then just click on make tools for each operation that I did. Then to make the tool, you have to copy the, um, to make the tool and write a Python script with um, fast MCP and using the, create some async, asynchronous functions, and it using the MCP tools decorator. Yeah, it's using the MCP tools decorator. You have to um, update the server.py file. Then um, you go, I'm using Cloud Code, for example, because it's easier to set up MCP. To me, I think it's easier to set up MCP. So um, I go to Cloud Code, sorry, I restart the server, server, go to the MCP server. It's running on localhost. Go to Cloud Code, type, um, create a card to test it. So it was working at some point, but I realized that one, it's not really, since this is a hackathon, it's not really that um, It's not really that good because I wanted it to automatically do it, but it seems like I'm the one that's teaching the AI how to. To create the msp and it's creating the msp as I'm doing it, so in future situations it can automatically do it. But the issue is that it's not creating automatically. So what I was imagining is maybe create a headless Selenium, Chrome headless Selenium. Then you get, okay, the way the msp also works is it gets the cookie sessions from the app as an extension. So in the code that you're copying when you click on make it true, it copies the cookie session into the clipboard. Then when you're pasting it on your server.py, it's pasting the cookie session, so it's able to work. So you can use it without API key or login. But I want to do the same thing too. But like, the only thing that you need to just copy the cookie session from, maybe create an extension to copy the cookie session and any authentication item that might be needed for the browsing. Then when you create Selenium, you inject the cookie session here, so before you open the website. When you inject the cookie session, it should automatically log you in. Then when you log in, as long as the cookie hasn't expired, we can assume it's the cookie hasn't expired because it's a hackathon. When you log in, there would be the, I don't know if Selenium can take screenshots, we can take screenshots. But if Selenium cannot take screenshots, then Selenium will just quickly open and take a screenshot of the whole page, then feed it to the AI at the back. Then also there will be some sort of function that clicks on every clickable item. in the website and it takes note of what's happening. So maybe multiple screenshots will be happening and they might all be fed to the AI. And as multiple screenshots are happening, maybe there'll be probably a JSON file or something that is taking note of the coordinates of every button click, everything that is happening. And we can assume that there are no pop-ups, no ads, nothing like that that is showing on the automatic MCP generator tool for the website that we are working on. We only need this thing to work on one website, and if it works on one website, then we can demo it in the hackathon. So can you make something like that? So using headless Selenium, maybe use headless Selenium, maybe don't use headless Selenium, use Gemini API, get all, make, do multiple button clicks, multiple keyboard inputs, any multiple things, just try to get every single information. Like, we are not using it for website, but think of it like using Microsoft Word. You are clicking all the buttons on Microsoft Word and you're seeing what they are doing. You're hovering and clicking, so do a hovering and clicking this thing and store everything somewhere. When you're generating the MCP tool, there will be a script for the MCP server, then there can be a script for the MCP tool where you just store the Python code, and it will update automatically, so you don't need to restart the server. So the way this one works is, you can use the exec exec function for multi-line Python string. Use the exec function instead. Instead of you updating the server.py file, stopping the server and updating it manually, you just use the exec. function exec function on Python, then the other part, creating the MCP and connecting the MCP to cloud, then cloud will be able to use it. So can you do something like that for me?
