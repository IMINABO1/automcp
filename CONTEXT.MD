# 🚀 Project Blueprint: AutoMCP (Powered by IBM Granite)

**Event:** IBM Dev Day: AI Demystified Hackathon

**Track:** AI Developer Tools / AI Agents

**Goal:** $5,000 First Place Prize

## 1. The Core Idea (The Pitch)

**The Problem:**
To give AI Agents "hands," developers currently have to manually read thousands of pages of API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI) and write boilerplate code for every single function. It takes days to onboard a single app like Trello or Linear.

**The Solution:**
**AutoMCP** is an autonomous "Tool Factory." It ingests raw API Documentation (via URL or file), intelligently selects the most useful endpoints, and uses **IBM Granite** to compile a fully validated **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** Server in seconds.

**The "Secondary" Feature (The Backup):**
For apps with *no* documentation, we include **"Ghost Mode"** (Chrome Extension) to capture network traffic and generate tools from user actions.
