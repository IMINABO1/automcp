## 1. The Core Idea (The Pitch)

**The Problem:**
Developers currently have to manually read thousands of pages of API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI) and write boilerplate code for every single function.  
It takes days to create MCP support for a single app like Trello or Linear.

**The Solution:**
**AutoMCP** is an autonomous Tool Factory.
It intelligently selects the most useful endpoints from a page, mapping user generated input to actions, and uses **IBM watsonx Orchestrate** to compile a fully validated **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** server in seconds.
